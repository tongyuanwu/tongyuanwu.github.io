My research focuses on the **carbon and biodiversity implications** of construction materials,
including cement, sand, and gravel.

## Biodiversity impacts of future aggregate mining

This project investigates how the extraction of construction aggregates—sand, gravel, and crushed stone—affects terrestrial biodiversity worldwide. By integrating global material flow analysis with spatial models of mining suitability and species richness, it quantifies the overlap between mining areas and high-richness regions. The results provide science-based insights to guide sustainable sourcing under future material demand scenarios.

## Integrating supply- and demand-side to decarbonize China's cement sector

This is my doctoral project, in which I developed an integrated framework to assess decarbonization pathways for China’s cement sector by linking material use, emissions, and carbon uptake. It combines supply-side technologies such as carbon capture and storage with demand-side strategies such as more intensive use of buildings. Overall, the framework provides insights into achieving net-zero emissions while balancing societal material needs and climate goals.
